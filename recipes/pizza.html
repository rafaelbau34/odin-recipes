    <h2><b><em>INGREDIENTS</em></b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound prepared pizza dough</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>

    </ul>
    <h2><b><em>DIRECTIONS</em></b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Allow dough to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 2 unequal pieces. One piece of dough should be smaller. Take the larger piece and press out into a square shape. Take the smaller piece and roll into a circle. Cut the circle in half.        </li>
        <li>Take a teaspoon of oil and brush a pizza stone. Position the dough square on the pizza stone with one point of the square pointing down.</li>
        <li>Position the straight side of a dough half circle along the upper left edge of the square. Place the other half circle along the upper right edge of the square. Press seams together to join.        </li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce over dough to 1/2-inch from the edge. Top pizza with shredded cheese, sausage and pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and crust is golden, 17 to 19 minutes. Let rest 3 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
